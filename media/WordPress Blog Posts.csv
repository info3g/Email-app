<p class=""drop-cap"">This is a longer post, but it is important for you to understand how acne forms as well as the various types of acne so that you know how to prevent it from forming in the future.</p>
<p>Every pore is lined with skin that (over time) will die and shed off. Normally, these dead skin cells would be carried away by sebum, aka our natural facial oil.</p>
<p><img class=""size-full wp-image-4320 aligncenter"" src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Scrub-NormalPore.png"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""333""></p>
<p>However, when dead skin cells are given the chance to accumulate inside the pore, it mixes with sebum to create a clog. <strong>It is imperative to get into the pore to flush out the dead skin and clogs before things get worse.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:html -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-603 aligncenter"" src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Scrub-Micromedone.png"" alt=""""></figure>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<p>With the blockage in place, C. acnes bacteria, which feeds off sebum, begins to flourish in the buildup. The bacteria create a biofilm within the hair follicle and produces several pro-inflammatory chemical signals that trip the immune system to send blood to the tissues surrounding the pore:</p>

<!-- wp:html -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-602 aligncenter"" src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Scrub-Buildup.png"" alt=""""></figure>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<p>As the immune system kicks in full gear, inflammation around the pore accelerates, leading to the dreaded red spot appearing on your face. Enzymes produced by P. acnes may eventually break the comedonal wall. If the rupture penetrates into the deeper dermis layer, local tissue destruction and scar formation become an issue:</p>

<!-- wp:html -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><br><img class=""wp-image-605 aligncenter"" src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Scrub-Rupture.png"" alt=""""></figure>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<p>We are often asked how one should handle acne when the red spots have already appeared.</p>
<p>At that point, the inflammation chain reaction has already set in motion and little can be done to alter its course. Reducing the inflammation may help, but the comedone trapped inside still needs to be worked out.</p>
<p><strong>The key is to prevent the cycle from starting.</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to hitting the root causes of clogged pores and acne, you'll need a formulation that is gentle enough to be left on your skin all night. This allows the formulation to penetrate deep into your pores delivering the ingredients that flush out dead skin and removing the material that creates plugs.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Out delivers medical-grade retinol and azelaic acid deep into your pores to flush out clogs and thereby breaking the cycle by making it much harder for sebum to pool up inside your pores</strong>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">[wpcs_item ids=""31278"" column=""1""]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pair Clear Out with the Protective Moisturizer in order to ensure that you have no issues with sensitivity.</p>

<h2>Products Which Are Ineffective</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stay away from these products as they are ineffective; they don't penetrate into the pore in order to address the underlying problems.:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Clay masks</strong> can be effective to soak up sebum on oily skin. However, it <strong>does little in slowing down sebum production</strong> nor does it reduce dead skin that is being produced inside the pore. Masks momentarily soak up oil and condition the surface of your skin but you’ll need to get deeper to clear out pores and stop breakouts.</li><li><strong>Scrubs</strong> are effective at removing dead skin outside of your pore. However, it does little to remove the dead skin inside your pore (see below illustrations), which is usually what causes clogs and pimples in the first place. Use scrubs to slough away the dull/sallow layer of dead cells on the surface of your skin but <strong>if you have active breakouts, scrubs may worsen acne because the abrasive particles can irritate and further inflame acne lesions.</strong> Wait until pimples have subsided before reaching for the scrub jar.</li><li><strong>Pore strips</strong> use adhesive materials in an attempt to pull out plugs from their heads. On the off chance, these strips may be effective at grabbing an exposed plug. However, <strong>most plugs exist under the surface where strips cannot reach</strong>. Furthermore, strips do not address the underlying issue which cause plugs to form.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the most common forms of acne and skin issues which we see at Clearly Basics. We provide steps on how to treat the acne as well as escalation steps as needed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Acne Vulgaris</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p><em>Vulgaris</em>. Sounds scary, right? In reality, it is just the opposite. Vulgaris is the Latin word for “common;” so despite how terrifying it may sound, this type of acne is normal and easy to treat.</p>
<p>Acne Vulgaris is largely driven by an accumulation of dead skin cells inside the pore.&nbsp; We see this most pronounced in people with combination skin: their breakouts usually occur on the dry patches of skin (not the oily areas where most would assume the breakouts would occur). The papules are small to regular sized (less than 5mm in diameter).</p>
<p><strong>Solution Step 1:</strong> <a href=""https://tryclearly.com/shop/clearout/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Clear Out</a> paired with the Protective Moisturizer will do the trick for acne vulgaris.&nbsp; This formulation is left on your skin where it has sufficient time for retinol + azelaic acid to get to work inside the pore. 98% of users who use the Clear Out see significant improvement after a single set.</p>
<p><strong>Escalation Step 2:</strong> If breakouts persist after three months, continue with the Clear Out and apply benzoyl peroxide onto the general areas where you continue to see breakouts. Cut out harsh cleansers or acids which may be weakening your lipid barrier. Consider reducing your intake of dairy, refined carbs and sugars. Eat foods high in zinc such as almonds or walnuts.</p>
<p><strong>Escalation Step 3:</strong> Consult your dermatologist regarding a prescription topical antibiotic or topical retinoid.</p>

<h2><strong>Hormonal Acne </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":69907,""sizeSlug"":""large""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HormonalAcne804x538px-750x502.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-69907""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hormonal acne appears the
week leading up to your period. It is typically found on the lower part of
one’s face – the jawline, chin and cheeks. Scarring is a big issue as new
pimples surface every month before the scar from the last wave has faded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Particularly in those with
dry/combination skin, hard lumps underneath the skin tend to build in their
chin and cheeks.&nbsp; These closed comedones
are very large and stubborn clogs that take up to five months to flush out. If
you have these, continue with Step 1 for five months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution Step 1:</strong> Use the <a href=""https://tryclearly.com/shop/triom/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Complete Trio (opens in a new tab)"">Complete Trio</a> to help to flatten existing pimples as well as fade the appearance of scars. If you get larger/deeper closed comedones on your chin or jaw, add &nbsp;benzoyl peroxide to work alongside the Power Duo during the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Escalation Step 2:</strong>&nbsp; If acne persists, drink 5 g of dried spearmint tea boiled in in 250 mL water for 5-10 min, twice a day. Consider reducing your intake of dairy, refined carbs and sugars. Eat foods high in zinc such as almonds or walnuts. Also consider augmenting with birth control.&nbsp; In particular the ingredient cyproterone acetate in Diane or drospirenone in Yaz.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Escalation Step 3: </strong>Consult your dermatologist regarding spironolactone as
it does not interfere with the hormone levels but stops androgens from binding
to your oil glands.&nbsp; In the extreme case
of hormonal acne, consider speaking to a endocrinologist regarding PCOS.&nbsp; Symptoms of PCOS include irregular periods
and hirsutism (male pattern hair growth) as well as severe acne. </p>

<h2>Adult-Onset Acne</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":69906,""sizeSlug"":""large""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdultAcne804x538px-750x502.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-69906""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technically defined as acne
after the age of 24, adult-onset acne often rears its ugly head due to changes
in lifestyle, environment and stress. There is a big overlap with hormonal acne
since changes like the use of contraceptives, pregnancy and menopause often
happen during adulthood.&nbsp; Distinguish
between the two based on the timing: Hormonal acne tends come the week leading
up to your period whereas adult acne is more sporadic across the month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution Step 1:</strong> We find that people in this group use many skincare products. If your acne is persistent, simplify your night time routine to a gentle cleanser and use the <a href=""https://tryclearly.com/shop/triom/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Complete Trio (opens in a new tab)"">Complete Trio</a> to flatten existing pimples as well as fade the appearance of scars. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we age, oil production decreases and you will find that your skin becomes more sensitive and easily irritated. If that is the case, use the <a href=""https://tryclearly.com/shop/moisturizer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Protective Moisturizer (opens in a new tab)"">Protective Moisturizer</a> to nourish and repair your skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Escalation Step 2:</strong> If acne persists after three months of using the
Power Duo, augment by applying a benzoyl peroxide gel in the mornings to the
general area where you are breaking out. Consider reducing your intake of
dairy, refined carbs and sugars. Eat foods high in zinc such as almonds or
walnuts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Escalation Step 3: </strong>Consult your dermatologist regarding a prescription
topical antibiotic or topical retinoid.</p>

<h2><strong>Closed Comedones </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":69905,""sizeSlug"":""large""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://tryclearly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ClosedComedones804x538px-750x502.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-69905""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commonly called blind pimples or under skin pimples, these stubborn clogs start as hard lumps underneath your skin and take up to five months to finally surface. When they surface, they often come as large cysts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Closed comedones associated
with hormonal acne usually occur on the cheeks, the chin and the back. Whereas
those associated with diet usually occur inside the neck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In each step, allot 5 months in order to see through a cycle. Resist the urge to pick at cysts since they can easily cause tissue damage.<br> <br><strong>Solution Step 1:</strong> Discontinue use of liquid foundation or long wear makeup as we often find that these products used by people who struggle with closed comedones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you get more than five closed comedones per month, skip to step 2.&nbsp; Otherwise, use the <a href=""https://tryclearly.com/shop/triom/"">Complete Trio</a> for five months in order to work out all of these stubborn clogs.&nbsp; Augment by applying benzyol peroxide (BP) gel in the mornings.&nbsp; BP is highly irritating so get as low concentration as you can.  Also, apply the BP once every three days until your skin adjusts.<br> <br>Be diligent about using Lighten Up after the cysts have flattened so that you can quickly fade away the red scar. Also, make sure to use sunblock when going outdoors. A red scar will collect melanin and turn brown when exposed to UV.&nbsp; Once it has turned brown, the acne scar can last up to two years!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Escalation Step 2: </strong>Consult a dermatologist regarding oral
medication.&nbsp; You will need this type of
strength to stop closed comedones from forming.</p>
